## Project Overview

The **HDS_practice** repository is my space for learning and practicing health data science. Throughout this journey, I will cover topics like data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization while applying these skills to health data. This project will include code examples, notes, and projects reflecting my growth.

## Courses and Topics

This repository will cover work from the following courses, each focusing on different aspects of health data science:

- **Statistical Foundations for Health Data Science (R)**: Biostatistics, probability theory, hypothesis testing, and statistical methods for health data.
- **Computing for Health Data Science (Python)**: Python programming, including data cleaning, manipulation, and basic data science workflows.
- **Management and Curation of Health Data (SAS)**: Health data storage, cleaning, management, and data curation using SAS.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (C)**: Implementation of data structures and algorithms relevant to health data.
- **Context of Health Data Science (Notes)**: Notes and insights into the broader context and challenges of health data science.
- **Health Data Analytics: Machine Learning (Python)**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for health data.
- **Health Data Analytics: Statistical Modelling (R)**: Statistical modeling approaches for health data, including linear and logistic regression.
- **Database Systems (RDBMS)**: Relational databases, SQL, and database management for health data.
- **Visualization and Communication of Health Data (R, Python)**: Best practices in visualizing health data for effective communication.
- **Big Data Management (Hadoop)**: Handling large-scale health data using Hadoop for big data analytics.

## Skills and Tools

In this project, I will use various tools and technologies, including:
- **Programming languages**: Python, R, SAS, C
- **Data management**: SAS, SQL, Hadoop, RDBMS
- **Libraries and frameworks**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, R packages
- **Statistical methods**: Hypothesis testing, regression models, biostatistics
- **Machine learning**: Supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation
- **Data visualization**: Effective communication of insights using R and Python
- **Big data management**: Hadoop and related technologies for managing large health datasets

## Structure

The repository will be organized into the following sections:

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for practice and projects.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks or RMarkdown files documenting analysis and projects.
- `scripts/`: Python, R, or SAS scripts for specific analyses or tasks.
- `projects/`: Larger projects applying a range of skills to real-world health data problems.
- `notes/`: Course notes and reflections.

## Resources

I will rely on various learning materials, including:
- Course materials from my health data science courses.
- Public health datasets from reputable sources.
- Online documentation and best practices for the tools and languages mentioned above.
